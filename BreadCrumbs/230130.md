- cacheTime이 만료되면, 그리고 폴링을 걸어놓지 않았다면, 트리거 되지 않는 이상 데이터 재요청 하지 않는건가?

  - chatGPT는 그렇다고 함.

    - Yes, that is correct. In React-Query, the cache time expiration only triggers a refetch if there is an active subscription to the query data, which means that the data is being displayed or used in some way in the UI.

```TSX
const { data, status } = useQuery("users", async () => {
const response = await axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
return response.data;
}, {
cacheTime: 5000
});
```

- In this example, the cacheTime option is set to 5000 milliseconds, meaning that the data will be considered stale after 5 seconds.
- If the data is displayed or used in some way in the UI, a refetch will be triggered automatically when the cache time expires.
- If there are no active subscriptions, the expired data will remain in the cache and will not be refetched until there is an active subscription again.
